"""
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts.
Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are
digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle
the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1

def correct(s):
    symbols = {
        "5": "S",
        "0": "O",
        "1": "I"
    }

    for key, value in symbols.items():
        s = s.replace(key, value)
    return s
