"""
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square
building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up
with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way
to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it!
You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
