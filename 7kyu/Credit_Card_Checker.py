""""
Write a function that checks whether a credit card number is correct or not,
using the Luhn algorithm.

The algorithm is as follows:

From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, moving left, double the
value of every second digit; if the product of this doubling operation is
greater than 9 (e.g., 8 Ã— 2 = 16), then sum the digits of the products
(e.g., 16: 1 + 6 = 7, 18: 1 + 8 = 9) or alternatively subtract 9 from the
product (e.g., 16: 16 - 9 = 7, 18: 18 - 9 = 9).
Take the sum of all the digits.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the
number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
The input is a string with the full credit card number, in groups of 4 digits
separated by spaces, i.e. "1234 5678 9012 3456"
DonÂ´t worry about wrong inputs, they will always be a string with 4 groups of
4 digits each separated by space.
